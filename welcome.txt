What is a Load Balancer?
A load balancer is like a traffic cop for internet requests.
It makes sure that no single server gets too busy by spreading out the work evenly across multiple servers.
This keeps websites and apps running smoothly and quickly.

Benefits of a Load Balancer:-

Reliability: By distributing traffic, load balancers ensure that if one server goes down, others can still handle the requests, making the service more reliable.
Scalability: Adding more servers as your website or app grows is easier with a load balancer. It automatically includes new servers in the traffic distribution.
Efficiency: Ensures that each server works efficiently without being overwhelmed, which helps in maintaining good performance and speed.
Security: Some load balancers also provide additional security features like protection against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
Flexibility: Supports different types of servers and configurations, making it adaptable to various needs and setups.
User Experience: Improves the overall user experience by reducing wait times and ensuring a smoother, faster service.


How Does it Work?
Round Robin: Takes turns. Each server gets a request in order, one after another.
Least Connections: Picks the server that is the least busy.
IP Hash: Sends the same user to the same server every time, based on their IP address.
Weighted Round Robin: Some servers are stronger, so they get more work. The load balancer gives more requests to these stronger servers.
Weighted Least Connections: Like Least Connections, but also considers how strong the servers are. Stronger servers get more work.
Least Response Time: Chooses the server that answers the fastest.
Health Checks: Constantly checks if servers are working well. If a server has problems, it stops sending requests to it.
In essence, a load balancer helps keep online services reliable and fast by making sure all the servers share the work equally.
